# Some custom dataviews

Each folder contains a dvjs view (view.js / view.css) and a readme to explain how to use them.

They're build on top of the fantastic [Obsidian-Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin and used with the [dv.view()](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview/api/code-reference/#dvviewpath-input) method inside regular .md notes.

The `query.js` file at the root is used by all my views. It contains utils function that let me query files with DataviewJs.
