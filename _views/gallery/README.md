# Obsidian Gallery

To explain very briefly, it is the same as the Jukebox view but without the music specific features


> [!IMPORTANT]
> This view is cool and all but if you really want a full fledged gallery of your notes, please use the [Note gallery plugin](https://github.com/pashashocky/obsidian-note-gallery) instead. It covers way more thing than what I've built
